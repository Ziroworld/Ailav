## Introduction

### Project Introduction
In an increasingly digitized world, convenience is a key driver for consumer preferences. Local beverage shops struggle to compete with larger retail chains due to a lack of technological infrastructure. Ailav aims to bridge this gap by providing a mobile application that connects local beverage vendors with nearby customers, ensuring quick, reliable, and cost-free liquor delivery.

### Justification of the Project

#### Background of the Project
Nepal's growing smartphone penetration and urbanization have led to a rising demand for convenience-driven services. However, local beverage vendors face difficulty competing with larger players. Ailav seeks to empower these small businesses by leveraging technology to create an accessible and efficient ordering system.

#### Problem Statement
Local beverage shops, particularly in urban areas like Kathmandu Valley, lack visibility and convenient delivery systems. This leads to customer loss to larger retail chains. Consumers also struggle to find and support local vendors. Ailav solves this issue by providing an innovative platform for vendors to showcase their products while offering free, reliable delivery.

### Description of the Project

#### Features of the Project
- **Vendor Listings:** Local beverage shops can register, showcase products, and manage inventory.
- **Location-Based Recommendations:** Uses GPS to connect customers with nearby vendors for faster delivery.
- **Seamless Order Placement:** Easy-to-navigate UI for browsing, selecting, and ordering beverages.
- **Integrated Payment Options:** Supports eSewa, Khalti, and cash-on-delivery.
- **Free Delivery Services:** Ensures rapid and cost-free delivery.
- **Ratings and Reviews:** Customers can rate vendors and provide feedback.
- **Loyalty Program:** Encourages repeat orders through discounts and incentives.

## MVVM Design Pattern for Ailav
Ailav follows the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** design pattern for a structured separation of concerns.
- **Model:** Manages data and business logic.
- **View:** Handles the user interface.
- **ViewModel:** Acts as a mediator between the two.

MVVM enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability, ensuring seamless data binding and responsive UI updates.
